Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Schema Adherence**: Extract data strictly according to the schema keys provided. Each field in the schema represents a potential data point in the document. Ensure that the extracted data aligns with the specified types and descriptions.\n\n2. **Field Extraction**: For each field in the schema:\n   - \"claim_id\": Look for any unique identifiers that may represent the claim.\n   - \"claimant_name\": Identify the name of the person or entity submitting the claim.\n   - \"claimant_contact\": Extract contact information such as email, phone, or address.\n   - \"claim_type\": Determine the type of claim, such as bank dispute, insurance, or chargeback.\n   - \"claim_date\" and \"incident_date\": Extract dates related to the claim submission and the incident.\n   - \"account_identifier\": Look for account numbers, policy numbers, or reference identifiers.\n   - \"amount_claimed\" and \"currency\": Identify the monetary amount and currency code.\n   - \"counterparty\": Extract the name of the merchant, bank, or other involved party.\n   - \"claim_reason\" and \"claim_details\": Capture the reason and detailed description of the claim.\n   - \"supporting_documents\": List any explicitly mentioned attachments or evidence.\n   - \"resolution_requested\": Identify what the claimant is asking for, such as a refund or investigation.\n\n3. **Handling Nested Structures**: If the document contains nested fields or lists of objects, infer the structure from the descriptions and extract accordingly. Pay special attention to lists like \"supporting_documents\" and ensure they are captured as lists of strings.\n\n4. **Table Handling**: For documents with tables, such as invoices or forms:\n   - Handle markdown tables where data may span multiple rows.\n   - Carefully merge multi-row entries into single objects, ensuring no data is lost or misrepresented.\n\n5. **Precision and Clarity**: Maintain high precision in data extraction, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the representation of each field. Avoid assumptions beyond the provided descriptions and schema constraints.\n\nBy following these instructions, you will ensure that the extracted data is accurate, complete, and aligned with the schema requirements."
